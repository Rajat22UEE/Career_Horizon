# üöÄ Career Horizon - Full-Stack Job & Internship Portal

Welcome to Career Horizon! This is a full-stack monorepo project designed to connect students and professionals with job and internship opportunities. The platform is divided into three core components: a user-facing frontend, a secure admin panel, and a robust backend API.

---

## üèõÔ∏è Project Architecture

The project follows a clean, decoupled architecture:

* **Backend (`/backend`):** A Node.js/Express REST API that serves data, handles business logic, and manages the MongoDB database. It's the single source of truth.
* **Admin Panel (`/admin`):** A Next.js application providing a secure dashboard for administrators to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on jobs, internships, and HR contacts.
* **Frontend (`/frontend`):** A public-facing Next.js application where users can browse and search for opportunities listed by the admins.

**Data Flow:**
`Admin Panel ‚ÜîÔ∏è Backend API ‚ÜîÔ∏è Frontend`

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

* **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB (with Mongoose), JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for authentication.
* **Frontend & Admin Panel:** Next.js (App Router), React, Tailwind CSS.
* **Deployment:** Vercel (for Frontend & Admin), Render (for Backend).
