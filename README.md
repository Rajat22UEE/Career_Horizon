# ðŸš€ Career Horizon

## ðŸ“œ Explanation

Career Horizon is a full-stack job and internship portal designed to bridge the gap between students and employers. The project is built on a modern monorepo architecture, separating the backend API, the user-facing frontend, and the administrative panel into distinct, manageable applications. This structure ensures a clean separation of concerns and enhances scalability.

## âœ¨ Features

* **Decoupled Architecture:** A robust Node.js backend serves data to both a public Next.js frontend and a secure Next.js admin panel.
* **Comprehensive Listings:** Provides dedicated sections for full-time jobs, internships, and HR contacts.
* **Role-Based Access:** Public users can browse listings, while authenticated admins have full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) capabilities.
* **Centralized Management:** A single codebase (monorepo) makes it easy to manage dependencies and maintain consistency across the entire platform.
